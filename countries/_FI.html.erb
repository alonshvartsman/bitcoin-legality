  <p>Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are legal in Finland.</p>
  <p>The Finnish Tax Administration has issued instructions for the taxation of virtual currencies, stating that rather than a currency or a security, a bitcoin transaction is considered a private contract equivalent to a contract for difference for tax purposes. Purchases of goods with bitcoin or conversion of bitcoin into legal currency "realizes" the value and any increase in price will be taxable with losses not being tax-deductible.</p>
